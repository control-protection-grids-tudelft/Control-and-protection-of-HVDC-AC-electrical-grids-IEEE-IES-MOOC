# MATLAB codes
### Codes for lectures in course EE4545 and MOOC Control and protection of HVDC/AC electrical grids.
 
There are 4 different libraries:

-[A1 MMC Control Design](/MATLAB/A1%20MMC%20control%20design) models following the lectures of modules C1 and C2 of the MOOC. These files rely on the generalized MMC model [[1]](#1) and
the control design described in [[2]](#2) and [[3]](#3). Using these files is formulated [Assignment 1](/MATLAB/A1%20MMC%20control%20design/Assignment%201%20-%20MMC%20design%20and%20control.pdf).

Files created by: A. Lekić

-[A2 MTDC Control](/MATLAB/A2%20MTDC%20control) is MATLAB/Simulink library following MOOC's module C2. These files represent use of different control strategies
for controlling the MTDC electrical grid. It is based on the publication [[4]](#4). The [Assignment 2](/MATLAB/A2%20MTDC%20control/Assignment%202%20-%20MTDC%20controls.pdf) uses this library.

Files created by: V. Nougain

-[A4 DC links in distribution networks](/MATLAB/A4%20DC%20links%20in%20distribution%20networks)
