   CURVE FITTING OUTPUT
===================================================

 Fitting Characteristic Admittance Matrix Yc
    ( using "YC_fitter" function ). 
===================================================

 The Error target specified by the User in fitting Yc is the 
     ratio of the "largest error" over the "largest magnitude".
     The "largest error" is the largest absolute value of the 
     difference between an original Yc element and the corresponding
     Yc element produced by fitting over all frequencies.
     The "largest magnitude" is the largest absolute value of
     an original Yc element over all frequencies.

 In this case, the User has specified a 
    maximum relative error of 0.100000 percent.

 The fitting process has achieved a 
    maximum relative error of 0.098285 percent
    using 14 poles.


 Fitting Propagation Function using "H_fitter" function.
===================================================

 The User defined target for propagation matrix fitting
   is to specify a requested maximum magnitude of error
   between the elements in the original H matrices and 
   the corresponding elements in the fitted H matrices 
   over all of the frequencies.

 In the present case the User requested a maximum error 
   expressed in per unit of:
    "max_abs_err_in_fitting_H_phase_mats_pu" = 0.002000

  In achieving this target, the maximum number of 
    poles per propagation delay group has been
    specified by the User to be:  20 poles.

     --------------------------

  The overall H fitting algorithm automatically sets 
    a fairly easily reached TARGET ERROR for the
      "max_ABS_err_in_fitting_this_H_group" 
    and iteratively reduces the target to force a more
    accurate fitting for all the propagation groups.
  In this regard, before entering the OUTER loop we set:
     max_allowed_max_ABS_err_in_fitting_any_H_group = 0.25
  We will reduce this target by multiplying it by a factor of 0.5
    whenever we need to make another pass through the OUTER LOOP.
  NOTE: "max_ABS_err_in_fitting_this_H_group" is 
         The maximum magnitude of the error between  
         fd_fcn_fitted[fn_idx][j] and fd_fcn_orig[fn_idx][j]  
         propagation values over all frequencies.

    MODEL ORDER REDUCTION based on residue/pole ratio
    =================================================

   The function: find_residues_for_H_ph_mats() has calculated
     the residues associated with each of the poles.
     It has also found the maximum residue/pole ratio for all of
     the real poles to be "max_residue_pole_ratio" = 3.885972e-001
   Having a large "max_residue_pole_ratio" has been associated
     with inaccuracy in the fitting result and is generally 
     associated with using too many poles in the fitting.
     Therefore, advanced Users may specify an upper limit target 
     on "max_residue_pole_ratio". 
     The default is to specify a very high limit such as 2.0e6 
     to avoid the Model Order Reduction process. 
   The User in this case has specified an upper limit target
     for such a ratio of:  2.000000e+006.

   In this case, there is no need to attempt to lower 
     residue/pole ratio by eliminating select poles since  
     the ratio is already <= to the User specified ratio limit.
