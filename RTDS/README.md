### Authors: V. Nougain, A. Shetgaonkar, and A. LekiÄ‡, emails: {V.Nougain, A.D.Shetgaonkar, A.Lekic}@tudelft.nl
### Codes for lectures in course EE4545 and MOOC Control and protection of HVDC/AC electrical grids.
 
Real-time Protection of the MMC-based multi-terminal HVDC electrical grids with North Sea ratings.

There are two libraries:
-[Advanced controllers library](/RTDS/Control) which follows the tutorial about comparison of classical and advanced controllers for the MMC-based HVDC grids. The description of the tutotials is given [here](/RTDS/Control/Advanced Controllers.pdf).
-[Protection library](/RTDS/Protection) which follows the tutorial about [fault identification](/RTDS/Protection/Identification.pdf) and [fault location](RTDS/Protection/Location.pdf) for the MMC-based HVDC grids.
