# HVDC-based RTDS models
### Authors: V. Nougain, A. Shetgaonkar, and A. Lekić, emails: {V.Nougain, A.D.Shetgaonkar, A.Lekic}@tudelft.nl
### Codes for lectures in course EE4545 and MOOC Control and protection of HVDC/AC electrical grids.
 
Real-time Protection of the MMC-based multi-terminal HVDC electrical grids with North Sea ratings. These libraries are based on the paper [[1]](#1), which is used as the basis.

For more information about the models, please refer to: https://github.com/control-protection-grids-tudelft/HVDC-RTDS-models.

The introduction to RSCAD/RTDS can be found in the [reader](/Readers/Reader.pdf).

There are two libraries:

-[Advanced controllers library](/RTDS/Control) which follows the tutorial about comparison of classical and advanced controllers for the MMC-based HVDC grids. The description of the tutotials is given [here](/RTDS/Control/Advanced%20Controllers.pdf).

For more information, check the publications [[2]](#2), [[3]](#3), and [[4]](#4).

-[Protection library](/RTDS/Protection) which follows the tutorial about [fault identification](/RTDS/Protection/Identification.pdf) and [fault location](/RTDS/Protection/Location.pdf) for the MMC-based HVDC grids. 

For more information, check the publications [[5]](#5), and [[6]](#6).
