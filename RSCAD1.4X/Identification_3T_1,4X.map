    For VSC Bridge named VALVE_CSA1 in subsystem 1,
    following is the order of execution of VSC components
    that have both named-signal input and named-signal output.
    These components are referred to as "mid-list" components
    because they come after components that have exclusively
    named-signal output ( "prefix" components )
    and before components that have exclusively
    named-signal input ( "suffix" components ).
